      <li><a>Everyone was very kind. They did all they could for my 18 year old cat, but she had to be put to sleep. Everyone was so nice to us during that hard time. -

      <li><a>Dr. Martin and his staff are the best! I recently moved to Lexington from Florida. My brother recommended Beech Lake Animal Hospital for my spoiled fur babies. We were welcomed with true Southern Hospitality. The staff is very professional and friendly. -Kathleen M Kirkpatrick </a></li>
